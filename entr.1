.Dt ENTR 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm entr
.Nd run arbitrary commands when files change
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cdr
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Op Ar /_
.Nm entr
.Ar +fifo
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss EXEC Mode
.Nm entr
has two modes of operation; the first reads a list of files provided on the
standard input and executes the supplied
.Ar utility
if any of them change.
.Nm
waits for the child process to finish before responding to subsequent file
system events.
A TTY is also opened before entering the watch loop in order to support
interactive utilities.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Execute
.Pa /usr/bin/clear
before invoking the
.Ar utility
specified on the command line.
.It Fl d
Track the directories of regular files provided as input and exit if a new file
is added.
This option also enables directories to be specified explicitly.
Files with names beginning with
.Ql \&.
are ignored.
.It Fl r
Launch the
.Ar utility
at startup and reload it by sending
.Dv SIGTERM
if one of the source files change.
.Nm
waits for the
.Ar utility
to exit to ensure that resources such as sockets have been closed.
.El
.Pp
The first occurrence of
.Ar /_
on the command line will be replaced with the absolute path of the first file that was modified.
If the restart option is used the first file under watch is treated as the default.
.Ss FIFO Mode
The second mode also reads a list of filenames provided on the standard input
and is enabled by specifying
.Ql +
and the name of a fifo.
In this mode
.Nm
enables more sophisticated scripting by writing filenames to a named pipe when
they are modified.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If
.Ev PAGER
is undefined,
.Nm entr
will assign
.Pa /bin/cat
to prevent interactive utilities from waiting for
keyboard input if output does not fit on the screen.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Li 0
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGTERM
was received
.It Li 1
No regular files were provided as input or an error occurred
.It Li 2
A file was added to a directory while using the while using the directory watch
option
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Rebuild a project if source files change, showing only the first 20 lines of
output
.Pp
.Dl $ find src/ | entr sh -c 'make | head -n 20'
.Pp
Launch and auto-reload a node.js server:
.Pp
.Dl $ ls *.js | entr -r node app.js
.Pp
Clear the screen and run a query:
.Pp
.Dl $ echo my.sql | entr -c psql -f /_
.Pp
Rebuild project if a source file is modified or added to the src/ directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ while sleep 1; do ls src/*.rb | entr -d rake; done
.Pp
Convert individual Markdown files to HTML if they're modified:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ls *.md | entr +notify &
$ while read F; do
>     markdown2html $F
> done < notify
.Ed
